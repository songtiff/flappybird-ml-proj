# Flappy Bird Using Python NEAT  
cr: Tech With Tim 

### Description
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) plays Flappy Bird. NEAT is a genetic algorithm designed to
efficiently evolve artificial networks. In this program, generations of flappy birds take on the task of 
avoiding the pipes (collision is accounted for) and with every passing pipe, the flappy birds gain a fitness score
prompting flappy to pass more pipes. As the generation increases, the new reproduced flappy birds (will be reproduced from
the very best of the previous generation) will perform even better.
